# Time complexity in computer science describes how the execution time of an ##algorithm grows as the input size increases. it essentially quantifies the #number of operation an algorithm performs as a function of the input data size.

#Asymptotic notation is a notation that provides a way to describe the growth rate of a function as the input size grows.
# Best Case (O(omega) , Average Case (O(theta)) , Worst Case (O(oh))

# types of time complexities 

# 1. O(1) - constant time complexity
# 2. O(log n) - logarithmic time complexity
# 3. O(n) - linear time complexity
# 4. O(n^2) - quadratic time complexity
# 5. O(2^n) - exponential time complexity
